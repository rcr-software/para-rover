# Installation

Make sure your Python and pip are both Python 3. Then install requirements with:

`pip -r requirements.txt`

Then, connect the joystick and run `python joystick_test.py`. That's it!

If you have `python` and `python3` installed, then use `python3` and `pip3` where applicable.

# GUI

There is not GUI yet.

# Issues

The toggles on the joystick don't show up in pygame.joystick, we might need to switch to a different
input library. The joysticks work, though.
